<h1>The Weekly Review</h1>
<h2>Checking on your Checklists</h2>

When people think about productivity and David Allen's [Getting Things Done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_things_done) system, they often think about creative ways to approach planning, checklists and the notion of ubiquitous capture. 

What can get overlooked is actually the most important part of the system: **the weekly review**.  Getting a chance to step back and review once a week is vital for understanding where you’re going, what you’re truly doing, and what’s left to be done.

Allen breaks out your priorities into **six levels**:

* Runway - Current Actions
* 10,000 feet - Current Projects
* 20,000 feet - Areas of Responsibility
* 30,000 feet - 1-2 Year Goals
* 40,000 feet - 3-5 Year Goals
* 50,000 feet - Life Goals

You should evaluate everything 20,000 feet and above a few times a year.  Current Actions and Current Projects, though, are small enough to be looked in on once a week.

<h3>Performing a Review</h3>

To begin, you'll want to…

**GATHER**:
* Loose Papers and Materials* Your Inboxes and Process them to Zero* Any Open Loops in your Head (including new ideas, nagging thoughts, and "I should" reminders)then **REVIEW**:
* Your Calendar (past and future)* Your Task List (completed and open)* Your Waiting On List and Someday/Maybe List* Your Major Projects Statuses

then **IDENTIFY**:

* Collect everything you've just gathered into a single system
* Identify what needs to happen before your upcoming events and milestones
* Ruthlessly purge the unnecessary (or store things for reference)

Allen actually provides a great checklist for performing the review available as a [free download](https://secure.davidco.com/store/catalog/GTD-WEEKLY-REVIEW-p-16165.php). 

<h3>Using a Trigger List</h3>

You might find it tough to start this process without a jumping off point.  Allen actually created a pretty robust [trigger list](http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Trigger_List) to help jog your memory.  Essentially, this list is an overview of all the areas of work and life you might find yourself in.  Just by reading through it, I am certain several items will jump out at you and *trigger* some thought you need to capture.

<h3>Keeping Going</h3>

Allen says you're doing the review right when you can honestly identify everything you're *not* doing.  At its core, Getting Things Done is about feeling good about the decisions you make in doing some things instead of others.

Getting Things Done acknowledges that our work is never over and that there's always going to be more to do than what's possible in a given day. The review is in place to ensure you're not forgetting something truly important, yet allowing yourself the ability to say "not yet" without guilt.
