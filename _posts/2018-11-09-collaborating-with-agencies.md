Recently the awesome folks at [Alpha](https://alphahq.com) invited me to speak on their podcast, [This Is Product Management](https://www.thisisproductmanagement.com). I'm a longtime listener of this show, finding it full of insights and tactics for the modern PM. I was just delighted to add my voice to the show.


The episode is titled, [Collaborating with Agencies is Product Management](https://www.thisisproductmanagement.com/episodes/collaborating-with-agencies/). I'm really fortunate to have worked with some incredible agency teams, both on the agency side and as a client. In this episode, I break down strategies for planning, collaborating, and improving working relationships with agency partners.
