# Responsibilities of the Product Manager

## Opportunities 

The product manager position must be able to collect new product ideas from multiple sources including customers, competitors customers, industry analysis, LifeVests’ executives, sales and marketing staff, product development team, customer service representatives, operations staff, and your own experience of and knowledge of the market and technology. These ideas must be effectively evaluated and pursued based on value gained or passed over due to lack of market value or lack of cost benefit. The other outcomes (opportunity missed or moving forward with a poor opportunity) are both undesired outcomes.

### Users, Business, Technology

The product manager’s mission is to achieve business success by meeting user needs through the continuous planning and execution of digital product solutions. In the Venn diagram of Users, Business, and Technology, the product manager sits at their intersection.

The ultimate measure of success is the health of the business, and therefore the value that the product provides to users. The product manager should identify and assess the validity and feasibility of product opportunities and groom the product roadmap accordingly. They should lead the team in the execution of that roadmap, and evangelize it internally to the executive team and colleagues. Also, the product manager should study and ultimately represent customers throughout the product development process.

Success for the product manager ultimately comes from measuring user happiness, business goals, and working technology.

### Right Product/Right Time

It is easy to define fantastic products that can’t be built, or at least can’t be built profitably or in the necessary timeframe. It is equally easy to define products that can be built profitably but which are not compelling to the customer.

Exercising good insight and judgement, the product manager manager must be effective in evaluating the opportunities gathered for multiple sources and understanding the capabilities of the engineering team to come up with a product definition that is both compelling and achievable. Generally, the product manager identifies the product requirements and captures them for the product team in some sort of specification.  The owner for the requirements and the person ultimately responsible that those are the right requirements is the product manager. 

### Roadmap

The course a product will take over time is also the responsibility of the product manager.  Once the product manager has painted a clear and compelling picture of where the product is intended to go over the next few years, the product roadmap should chart the course to get there. What capabilities and releases should happen when? What markets will be served by each release? The specifics of each release along the way are then covered in the product requirements for each version.

The product manager is responsible for this product strategy and the steps that will get the product from here to there. The strategy and roadmap should reflect the input and buy-in of the full product team, and should be reviewed and approved by the company executives. 

## Characteristics

As with all opportunities at LifeVest, the role will require skills that must be learned, but there are some traits that must be exhibited that will aid in learning and professional development.

### Product Passion

Good product managers have a love and respect for good products, no matter where they come from, and they live to create them. This passion for product is an essential ingredient as it will often be called upon to provide the motivation to get through the many very difficult challenges. Further, the product manager will need to inspire the rest of the product team, and the passion for a product is contagious.

The product manager should be curious and analytical about the product. They should monitor it for weak points and work to improve them. They should understand that a Minimal Viable Product isn't just functional, but it's something a user can enjoy no matter how simple (and they should, where possible, instead embrace a Minimum Loveable Product).

### Empathy

The ideal product manager does not necessarily have to come from the target market (there are pros and cons to this), but they absolutely need to be able to empathize with that target market. Where possible, the product manager should include the end user in the product process. Qualitative methods include participatory design workshops, interviews, surveys, and usability studies. Quantitative methods include task analysis, application analytics, digital marketing experiments, and A/B testing.

The product manager should understand user's pain, focused on solving their problems. They should use a "jobs to be done" or similar framework of understanding the core purpose or "Why?" of the product.

Similarly, the product manager should maintain empathy and positive relationships with all departments within the company. This includes collaborating with engineering, but also sales, marketing, legal, finance, customer support, and leadership. The product manager should strive to give each team what they need to be successful, and not to take too much time away from those tasked with completing key tasks.

### Integrity

This trust and respect is built over time by the good product manager demonstrating the traits and skills of a strong product team leader. If the product manager is not perceived to have integrity, or honesty, or fairness when dealing with her teammates, then the product manager will not have the degree of collaboration and team effectiveness that she needs to get the job done. The good product manager may not be an expert in every role of the product team, but she should have a deep understanding and respect for what each team member is responsible for, and she should be willing and able to trust those people to do their job. 

As the main interface between the product team and both the executive team and the sales organization, the product manager is often put in difficult situations, such as being asked to deliver products earlier, or with special features for large customers. The product team will watch closely how the product manager handles these challenges.

### Knowledge

Know your customer, know the product, know your competitors. Know what is feasible from a technological perspective, and understand the team's capabilities to deliver on their promises.

Utilize multiple research methodologies to maintain an understanding of the competitive landscape, the customer base, and user feedback. Balance these insights to prioritize the product roadmap, and defend those choices to leadership and customers.

## Skills

### Applying Technology

A big part of defining a successful product is in understanding new technology and seeing how it might be applied to help solve a relevant problem. While you don’t need to be able to invent or implement the new technology yourself in order to be a strong product manager, you do need to be comfortable enough with the technology that you can understand it and see its potential applications and explain its potential. The key here is to not simply find an application for a given cool technology. Rather, you want to start with the pressing problem you’re trying to solve for the customer, and then look opportunistically and creatively at the array of technologies available that might be able to help. Additionally, you must be able to speak about the organization of the application as it is in its state at any given moment. This includes a level of confidence assessing rough timelines and effort estimates for the size and scope of a proposed idea.

### Focus

> “The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.” 

The ability to keep the focus on the key problem to be solved, and not to succumb to creeping featurism, or the loud voices of a few key people or customers, requires tremendous discipline - both company discipline and personal discipline. 

A product manager needs to be a leader who can look into the future and think strategically. They need to be able to develop a vision for where a product should go — and they need to be able to communicate and outline the steps toward that vision effectively. They should also balance priorities and adjust the vision accordingly in response to the changing market and business needs.

### Communication

Collaboration is key in the product management role. A product manager should be able to communicate with, and to, all members of the team in regards to developing the product. They should inspire the team towards identifying the best solution for a problem and not simply dictate their perspective as the answer. 

Team communication should be open, candid, and constructive. The product manager should be capable of delivering appropriate feedback, critique and praise. They should also help collect and synthesize communication from customers and users to ensure the right messages get through to the rest of the team.  They should also celebrate successes with the team and point out exceptional work from the team wherever possible.

They should be comfortable with multiple forms of written, verbal and drawn communication to help express ideas, problems and plans. This includes communicating with developers, but also sales/marketing, business leadership, customers and end users. All documentation and specifications should be as detailed as is necessary for the team's benefit. Specifications should be lightweight and understandable to a variety of audiences.

The product manager should respect Maker Schedules and Manager Schedules to ensure those in Maker positions aren't in too many meetings to be effective. Similarly, those with Manager Schedules should be equipped with the necessary information they need to move the business forward and participate in the right meetings.

### Process-Oriented

The team should embrace an iterative process that allows the team to fluidly hand work from one "lane" to another. As the product manager studies the product rollout process, she should be comfortable with identifying efficiencies and systems to improve the process. Ultimately this process should be defendable and contribute to the development and release of iterations of the product. 

Company culture, team efficiency and productivity should not be sacrificed for process' sake; rather, the process should be flexible enough to change and grow as needed.

The process should help the entire team have greater clarity around the product roadmap, both in terms of the requirements and the effort needed to achieve them. The product manager should push for clear requirements and accurate estimates, knowing that both are subject to change. The product manager should set expectations regarding the roadmap and work to keep it up-to-date and accurate.

### Problem Solving

Address feature requests, user feedback, and technical debt as problems to be solved (or "jobs to be done" by the product). The product manager should analyze customer feedback, task / flow failures, and feature requests to understand the underlying issues, not what's just being said on the surface.

The product manager should utilize an unbiased framework of tackling and dissecting the problems to help identify the best solutions. This process should include the team at large: this includes the development team (both to include their perspective and to help them gain empathy and understanding), and the leadership team (to ensure requirements are heard and solutions are acceptable).

### Time Management

It is so very easy to come in to work early in the morning, work frantically all day even skipping food and meetings, and then head for home well into the evening, not having actually accomplished anything important for your product. That is because the day has been spent chasing fires and working on “urgent” items. It is absolutely essential to get very skilled at distinguishing that which is important from that which is urgent, and to learn to prioritize and plan your time. If you can’t manage to get the time to focus on those tasks which are truly important to your product, the product will fail. 

Common sources of lost time is meetings, instant messages, and emails. Especially when the product manager thinks every email and meeting about the product should be paid attention– the engineering status meetings, the test planning meetings, the marketing meetings, usability test planning meetings, etc. While there will be certain times where these meetings are important, they should be the exception rather than the rule, and the product manager should attend at the invitation of the relevant manager in order to present specific information. 

Product management requires a constant awareness of how your time is being spent, always asking yourself if what you are doing can be leveraged, or asking yourself if you really need to attend that meeting, or weigh in on that e-mail thread. 

Product management may require a quarter of the day for true thinking time – time to reflect on the product and the strategy; to step back from the fires of the moment and look at how the product is doing holistically. This is also a good time to look at competitive products or investigate emerging technologies.
