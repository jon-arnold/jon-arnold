## Hi! I'm Jon Arnold, a user experience strategist, product manager and workshop facilitator.

I’m passionate about great experiences, both in software and in physical spaces. I share this love with my clients by facilitating workshops that help companies develop optimal user interactions, build products with purpose and create meaningful business strategies.

### How do I do this?

I work hard to collect research, insights and perspective in proven, systematic and interactive ways from both employees and customers. I'm passionate about learning, listening, and understanding people to get to the heart of a real issue and work together to create something **better**.

I’ve worked with start-ups, non-profits, and Fortune 100 companies to create shared understanding, new products and features, business processes and solved problems.

I'm also a **Scrum Certified Product Owner (SCPO)** and I love working with product teams on building and shipping the right things for their users.
